<p><strong>Whitespace:</strong></p>
<p>Many times referred to as negative space, is the portion of a page left unmarked, the portion that is left blank and or empty space in a page. In web design terms, it&rsquo;s the space between graphics, columns, images, text, margins and other elements. It is the space left untouched in order to smooth things out and transform a page into something elegant. It is also the blank space that reminds us that simpler designs are beautiful and that we don&rsquo;t need to create a layout filled with text and graphical elements to deliver a clear and direct message.</p>
<p>Even though we call it white space, it doesn&rsquo;t mean the actual space must be white. The blank space may be filled with any color as long as it is free of any elements like text or images. Whitespace is also associated with elegance and sophistication since it is a way to organize text, organize elements and guide users attention to certain elements.</p>
<p>An example of great usage of whitespace that we are all familiar with is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>. Their homepage is filled with whitespace so we can focus on what is important: search.</p>
<p>Company: Google<br /> Link: <a href="http://google.com/">Google.com</a><br /> Example: Google has always been famous for Whitespace around there logos. This is the biggest recognized logo and marketing company in the world. We all use this on a daily basis. We probably just never recognized this as part of a Web Design Principle.</p>

<p><strong>Proximity:</strong></p>
<p>Describes to the spacing and balance of an image. This helps to illustrate relationships among objects: the closer objects are to each other shows they should be thought of as related, whereas the farther apart objects demonstrate how they should be thought of as separate entities.</p>
<p>Company: LA Times</p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://www.latimes.com/">https://www.latimes.com/</a></p>
<p>Example: Notice in my screenshot below how well balance the image(s) are with the articles the LA Times writes. They are using great balance from left to right and making sure it looks clean and not one side out of balance. They use the full webpage to their advantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Visual Hierarchy:</strong></p>
<p>Is the order in which a user processes information on a page; its function in the user interface (UI) design is to allow users to understand the information&nbsp;<em>easily</em>. By assigning different visual characteristics to sections of information (e.g., larger fonts for headings), a designer can influence what users will perceive as being further up in the hierarchy.</p>
<p>The visual characteristics that a designer can use to influence users&rsquo; perception of the information are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size:</strong>&nbsp;the larger the element, the more attention it will attract</li>
<li><strong>Color:</strong>&nbsp;Bright colors are more likely to draw attention over muted ones</li>
<li><strong>Contrast:</strong>&nbsp;dramatically contrasting colors will catch the eye easily</li>
<li><strong>Alignment:</strong>&nbsp;an element that breaks away from the alignment of others will attract more attention</li>
<li><strong>Repetition:</strong>&nbsp;repeating styles can give the impression that content is related</li>
<li><strong>Proximity:</strong>&nbsp;closely placed elements will also appear related</li>
<li><strong>Whitespace:</strong>&nbsp;more space around elements will attract the eye toward them</li>
<li><strong>Texture and style:</strong>&nbsp;richer textures will attract more attention than flat ones&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When information design does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;have a strong visual hierarchy, a user&rsquo;s eye follows a&nbsp;<em>predictable</em>&nbsp;reading path. This path is culturally influenced, as it is connected to the standard reading direction of written text. In the Western world, two main left-to-right paths exist, which can be described as a Z and an F pattern. A designer has the opportunity to use visual hierarchy to reinforce these natural paths, or deliberately use visual characteristics to break such patterns so as to draw the viewer&rsquo;s attention to a focal point. Thus, the successful manipulation of this hierarchy empowers designers to lead users, quite literally, along a cleverly devised visual journey to a goal.</p>
<p>Company: Square</p>

<p>Example: Notice how they use flow, repetition, whitespace, and proximity to really use it to their advantage. The simpler the better. Easier for the user to interact with. Higher click rates are driven this way.</p>
