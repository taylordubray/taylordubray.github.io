            <h3>Preparing Your Home for the Cold Season</h3>

            <span class="authorattribution">by Megan McBride</span>

            <p>With the cooler temperatures setting in and the changing colors of the leaves, we know that Fall is on its way. What many of us aren't so quick to think about is the maintenance that Autumn requires of us.</p>

            <p>There are countless articles on Google that emphasize all of the maintenance that every homeowner should consider, and it's a good idea to look into them further. In this article, we will cover a few of the basics in order to help prepare you and your loved ones for the oncoming cold season.</p>

            <p><strong>I. CLEAN GUTTERS</strong></p> 
            
            <p>Cleaning and inspecting your gutters is one of the very first things that you should look into. This will give you a chance to make sure that no <i>friends</i> are living in or near your home, and to ensure that there are no cracks or breaks in your gutters.</p>

            <p><strong>II. CHECK WINDOWS, DOORS, & ROOFS</strong></p>

            <p>When looking over your roof, be sure to keep an eye out for any shingles that are raised or missing, especially since these will cause major problems once winter strikes. Windows should also be inspected to make sure that the molding is in good condition and that there are no noticeable drafts. Homeowners are also advised to look over the kickplates and seals on any external doors, as this can save you money with your heating bill later on.</p>

            <p><strong>III. INSPECT YOUR BASEMENT</strong></p>

            <p>Take a walk around the basement in your home and look for any signs of mildew, cracks, or any other reasons for concern. Run water down the drains, especially in any unused bathrooms, to ensure that there are no clogs and that your home won't be in danger of flooding and/or backups.</p>

            <p><strong>IV. CHECK ANY SPRINKLERS, HOSES, & WATER SPOUTS</strong></p>

            <p>No homeowner wants to have any pipes freeze and burst with the coming cold. This can be avoided easily by shutting down your sprinkler system and draining the pipes, removing hoses from any faucets and draining them, and insulating or covering any spigots/faucets.</p>

            <p><strong>V. MOW, WEED & FEED YOUR LAWN</strong></p>

            <p>One of the best ways to keep your lawn happy and healthy is to mow it one final time before the cold season sets in. Shorter grass also means that mice and voles will be less likely to call the place home. You should also fertilize your lawn before the first frost sets in, as this helps it to recover from the wear and tear of summer.</p>

            <p>These may seem like daunting tasks initially, especially since all of us have busy schedules, but taking the time to make sure our homes are prepared for the cold season will save us time and a great deal of money. In taking care to avoid these problems, we can also ensure the safety and well-being of ourselves as well as our loved ones.</p>
